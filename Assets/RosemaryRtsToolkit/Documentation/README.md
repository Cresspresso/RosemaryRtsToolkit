# README

The Documentation folder covers some (but not all) of the systems in this toolkit.

The documentation is a bit lackluster, so we recommend experimenting with the Example Project.

To view images embedded in .md files, open it with Visual Studio Code, right click the tab, Open Preview (`Ctrl+Shift+V`).
